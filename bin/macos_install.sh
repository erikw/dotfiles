## Alternatives for global packages install
# * pipenv with a Pipfile:
#   - https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/
#   - However this is more for project package dependencies. Global install is not working (from https://stackoverflow.com/a/54342856)
# * Pipex: https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx
#  - However not offering any real benefits for my setup, there's not Pipefile or such to specify packages or versions needed.

# Install tmux session on login.
# Reference: http://www.launchd.info/
# NOPE starting tmux with launchctl makes it run with less access e.g. doing $(ls /volumes/somevolume) gives "Operation not permitted".
# thus, instead go for a simpler solution: Autostart;
# 1. Set Iterm.app to auto-start
# 2. Set iterm2 default profile to start irctor, and then have an additional profile that just runs zsh. see #irctorautostart below in the iterm section.
# old below:
#mkdir -p $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents
#cp $HOME/bin/com.user.irctor.plist $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/
#launchctl load -w $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.irctor.plist
#launchctl start com.user.irctor
#launchctl list | grep com.user.irctor
#launchctl unload -w $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.irctor.plist
# Start iterm2.app with tmux session loaded on login.
#cp $HOME/bin/com.user.iterm.plist $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/
#launchctl load -w $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.iterm.plist
#launchctl start com.user.iterm

#	(if this is not enough Iterm2 > Scripts (menu) > Manager > Install runtime)
## Start macos_appearance_monitor.sh on login.
cp $HOME/bin/com.user.appearancemon.plist $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load -w $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.appearancemon.plist
launchctl start com.user.appearancemon
# Create symlink so that ~/bin/solarized_iterm2_set.py works.
ln -s $HOME/Library/Application\ Support Library/ApplicationSupport
## Automate command for toggling system appearance mode
# * Create an automator Quick Action named "appearance_toggle" with AppleScript for the contents in ~/bin/macos_appearance_toggle.command
#	* NOPE use the build-in action "Change System Appearace" by dragging it in to the right, and set "Change Appearance" to "Toggle Light/Dark". This seems to go faster when toggling than the custom script.
# * Bind to shortcut CTRL+OPT+CMD+t (shortcut used when feature was first introduced in the OS).

# Amethyst
## General
# * Uncheck "Display layout when changing spaces".
# * Set the following layouts to be used: tall, fullscreen, floating.
## Floating
# * Add Pixelmator Pro, as the mouse hover tooltips are treated as own windows.

# Clipy
## General
# * Max clipboard history size: 85
## Menu
# * Number of items to place inline: 25
# * Number of items to place inside a folder: 60
# * Number of characters in the menu: 50
## Shortcuts
# * Menu>Main: NOP
# * Menu>History: Cmd+Shift+v.
# * Menu>Snipets: Cmd+Shift+b.
## Snippets
# Create snipets for some common items in ~/doc/tech/word_expansions.txt


# Firefox
## Firefox (menu bar) > Customize Touch Bar..
# * Replace Share with Reading mode.
# * Set up according to firefox.txt

# FreshBackMac
# NOPE replace by Irvue
# * Add to auto start in Settings > Users & Groups > Login items.
# * Set daily refresh
# * Turn off desktop notifications.

# Irvue
# Prefer this to Freshbackmac as one can get info about the selected wallpaper.
# NOTE switch to built-in dynamic wallpapers with dark/light mode.
## General
# * Folder for saved wallpaper: ~/media/images/wallpapers/usplash/
# * Uncheck Notifications
# * Check Load at startup:
## Shortcuts
# * Change wallpaper: Ctrl + Shift + Cmd + W (to be consistent with Freshbackmac)
# * Disable all other shortcuts as e.g. opt+cmd+r conflicts with Firefox reading mode, cmd+opt+s with iTerm solarized toggle.
# ** It's not enough to uncheck a shortcut, it's value has to be deleted otherwise it will be enabled again.


# Spotify Notifications

## General
### Closing
# * Make it easier to restart/poweroff by not confirming closing multiple windows - I always use tmux so it's not a problem.
#   - Uncheck: Confirm closing multiple sessions.
#   - Uncheck: Confirm "iTerm2 (#Q)" if windows open"
# * iterm.sh: If iterm2.app is closed, 2 windows will be opended by this script. To prevent this:
#	- Startup > Select "Only Restore Hotkey Window" NOPE don't do this anymore as of #irctorautostart
### Selection
# * Check "Applications in terminal may access clipboard" so that I can e.g. copy from vim buffer to gui clipboard.
## Profiles
#* After configuring the default profile, clone it in to a profile called "zsh" and remove the "Send text at start" #irctorautostart
### General
# * Send text at start: "irctor"   #irctorautostart
### Colors
# * Select color preset "Solarized Ligt". With macOs appearance following the sun, it's much more likely to be day time and thus no need to switch color in irctor on start.
### Text
# * Set font to either
# ** Source Code Pro, Regular, 14pt
# ** Terminus, Medium, 16pt
### Terminal
# * Check "Silence Bells"
### Terminal
# * Check "Unlimited Scrollback"
### Keys
# * Make Option key an Meta key, so e.g. tmux binding works on MBP internal keyboard.
#   - set "Left option key acts as" "Esc+". NOTE need karabiner-elements to get left alt to work on external PC keyboard.
# * Create shortcuts to toggle between solarized dark & light:
#	- Press the '+' button:>
#		- Shortcut: Opt + Cmd + s
#		- Action: "Load Color Preset" > "Solarized Light"
#	- Press the '+' button:>
#		- Shortcut: Opt + Cmd + shift + s
#		- Action: "Load Color Preset" > "Solarized Dark"



# Logitech G700s drivers
# * https://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/g700s-rechargable-wireless-gaming-mouse/downloads#


# Karabiner elements
# Karabiner elements works much better than built-in opt<->cmd swap in system preferences because this bult-in swap does not work properly in iTerm, as alt key is only working on laptop keyboard and not on external PC keyboard.
## HOWEVER, only use if needed. If having an external mac keyboard, keep to System Preferences bindings!
# * Disable all custom modifier keys remappings done in System Preferences.
# * For all keyboard
#	* caps_lock -> escape
#	* grave_accent_and_tilde(`) -> non_us_backslash
#		* Only when having the problem that tilde key is producing Â± instead. Reference: https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/367644/197493
# * For internal keyboard
#	* fn -> left_control
#	* left_control -> fn
# * For external keyboard (unless it's a proper Mac keyboard with comand and alt keys)
#	* left_command -> left_option
#	* left_option -> left_command


# Itsycal
# NOPE This is replaced with native Calendar widget!
# Preferences Save space by hiding built-in time in System Preferences > Date & Time > Clock > uncheck "Show date & time in menu bar".
## Appearance
# * Check "Use outline icon"
# * Check "Show day of week in the icon".
# * Datetime pattern: "" (as macOS clock can't be hidden starting from macOS 11).
# * Check "Show event location"
# * Check "Show calendar weeks"


# Semulov preferences
# NOPE replaced by Jettison
# NOTE Install again when https://github.com/kainjow/Semulov/issues/14 is solved, until then use ~/bin/macos_eject_external_disks.command
## Interface
# * Check "Show number of mounted in menubar"
# * Check "Show Ejec All menu item" and set the shortcut to Ctrl+Cmd+F12 or Cmd+Opt+Shift+E
## Ignore Volumes
#Recovery
#Boot OS X
#macOS Base System
#Macintosh HD - Data
## Miscellaneous
# * Launch at login

### Hotkeys
# * Eject external disks: ctrl + opt + cmd + e

# The Unarchiver
## Archive formats
# Enable for most archives. Might have to change in Finder for it to be the default program for some files.
## Extraction
# * Uncheck "Reveal expanded items in Finder".


# restic_backup.sh
# * If running restic from cron, then it seems like giving /usr/sbin/cron (and actually not restic(1)) full disk access prevents problems like
# "scan: Open: open /Users/$USER/Desktop: operation not permitted"
# System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access > add /usr/sbin/cron
