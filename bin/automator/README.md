# Automator.app commands
To make these as shortcuts:
1. Automator.app > New Service > Apple Script > paste contents of file inside the run function (and utility functions before run()).
1. System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Quick Action (Service) > assign same shortcuts as in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/xbindkeys/config but CMD instead of CTRL as CTRL+Fx does not seem to work.
