This is a combination of

and
https://blog.gskinner.com/archives/2011/10/media-keys-in-osx-for-any-keyboard.html

To make these as shortcuts:
* Automator > new Service > Apple Script > paste contents of file inside the run function (and utility functions before run()).
* System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Quick Action (Service) > assign same shortcuts as in ~/.xbindkeysrc but CMD instead of CTRL as CTRL+Fx does not seem to work.
