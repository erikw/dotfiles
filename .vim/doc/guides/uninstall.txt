Uninstalling
************

Uninstalling eclim consists of simply removing the eclipse and vim
plugins installed:

- <eclipse_home>/plugins/org.eclim*

  Remove all directories under plugins that start with org.eclim.

  - if you are using a package manager installed version of eclipse,
    then the plugins directory where eclim is installed may be under ~
    /.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_<version>/configuration/eclipse/plu
    gins

  - On Windows systems you can also remove all the eclim* files and
    ng.exe from your eclipse home directory.

  - On Linux, BSD, OSX, etc., you can remove the symlinks created to
    eclim and eclimd found in your eclipse home directory.

- <vimfiles>/eclim

  Remove the eclim directory under your vimfiles dir.

  - on unix based systems, this should be ~/.vim/eclim

  - on Windows systems, this should be %HOME%/vimfiles

- <vimfiles>/plugin/eclim.vim

  Lastly remove eclim.vim from your vim plugin directory.
