Eclim Headless Server Guide
***************************

The eclim daemon supports running both inside of the eclipse gui and
as a "headless" non-gui server.  However, even in the headless mode,
eclipse still requires a running X server to function.  If you are
running eclim on a desktop then this isn't a problem, but some users
would like to run the eclim daemon on a truly headless server.  To
achieve this, you can make use of X.Org's Xvfb server.

Note: This guide uses the Ubuntu server distribution to illustrate the
  process of setting up a headless server, but you should be able to
  run Xvfb on the distro of your choice by translating the package
  names used here to your distro's equivalents.

The first step is to install the packages that are required to run
eclipse and eclim:

- Install a sun jdk:

  >
     $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

  <

- Install Xvfb and some other gui related dependencies:

  >
     $ sudo apt-get install xvfb libgtk-directfb-2.0-dev x11-xkb-utils libgl1-mesa-dri

  <

The next step is to install eclipse.  Usually the eclipse version
found in your distro's package manager repository is behind the latest
versions found on eclipse.org and may not be supported by eclim any
longer.  So, the recommended means of installing eclipse is to
download a version from eclipse.org (http://eclipse.org/downloads/).
You can either use a console based browser like elinks, or you can
navigate to the download page on your desktop and copy the download
url and use wget to download the eclipse archive.  Once downloaded you
can then extract the archive in the directory of your choice.

   >

      $ wget <eclipse_mirror>/eclipse-<version>-linux-gtk.tar.gz
      $ tar -zxvf eclipse-<version>-linux-gtk.tar.gz

   <


Once eclipse is installed, you can then install eclim.  Since the
eclim installer does not yet support console installs, you can
checkout the code from git and build it:

- Install the necessary packages to build eclim:

  >
     $ sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core
     $ sudo apt-get --no-install-recommends install ant ant-optional

  <

- Clone eclim from the git repository and optionally checkout the
  version of eclim you wish to build (1.5.2 in this case):

  >
     $ git clone git://github.com/ervandew/eclim.git
     $ cd eclim
     $ git checkout 1.5.2

  <

- Then you can build eclim with the plugins you wish to enable (see
  the developers guide (|guides-development|) for more info on
  building eclim).

  >
     $ ant -Declipse.home=/home/ervandew/eclipse -Dplugins=ant,jdt

  <

  If you want to build in support for one or more eclim plugins for
  which the required dependency is not installed in your eclipse
  distribution, you can install the dependency using eclipse's p2
  command line client.  Make sure the command references the correct
  repository for your eclipse install (helios in this example) and
  that you have Xvfb running as described in the next step of this
  guide:

  >
     DISPLAY=:1 ./eclipse/eclipse -nosplash -consolelog -debug
       -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
       -repository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios
       -installIU org.eclipse.wst.web_ui.feature.feature.group

  <

  For a list of eclim plugins and which eclipse features they require,
  please see the installer dependencies (http://github.com/ervandew/ec
  lim/blob/master/src/installer/resources/dependencies.xml).  Note
  that the suffix '.feature.group' must be added to the dependency id
  found in that file when supplying it to the '-installIU' arg of the
  above command.

The last step is to start Xvfb followed by eclimd:

   >

      $ Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
      $ DISPLAY=:1 ./eclipse/eclimd start

   <


   When starting Xvfb you may receive some errors regarding font paths
   and possibly dbus and hal, but as long as Xvfb continues to run,
   you should be able to ignore these errors.

   The first time you start eclimd you may want to omit the 'start'
   argument so that you can see the output on the console to ensure
   that eclimd starts correctly.
