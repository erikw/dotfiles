Eclim Developers Guide
**********************

This guide is intended mostly for those who wish to contribute to
eclim by fixing bugs or adding new functionality, but the first
section is also useful for users who would like to use the latest
development version of eclim.

*development-build*


Checking out the code and building it.
======================================

1. Check out the code:

   >

      $ git clone git://github.com/ervandew/eclim.git

   <


   Once you have a local git repository you can utilize the extensive
   local git functionality allowing you to commit code locally, create
   local branches, etc.  For guidelines on managing patches and
   submitting them, please see the patch guide below.

1. Build eclim:

   >

      $ cd eclim
      $ ant -Declipse.home=/your/eclipse/home/dir

   <


   Note: If your eclipse home path contains a space, be sure to quote it:

        > ant "-Declipse.home=C:/Program Files/eclipse"

   This will build and deploy eclim to your eclipse and vim
   directories.  If you don't want to supply the eclipse home
   directory every time, you can set the environment variable
   ECLIM_ECLIPSE_HOME which the build script will then utilize.

   Note: If your vimfiles directory is not located at the default location
     for your OS, then you can specify the location using the
     "vim.files" property:

        >

           $ ant -Dvim.files=<your vimfiles dir>

        <


*development-patches*


Developing / Submitting Patches
===============================

The preferred means of developing and submitting patches is to use a
github fork. Github provides a nice guide to forking
(http://help.github.com/forking/) which should get you started.

Although using a github fork is preferred, you can of course still
submit patches via email using git's format-patch command:

>

   $ git format-patch -M origin/master

<


Running the above command will generate a series of patch files which
can be submitted to the eclim development group
(http://groups.google.com/group/eclim-dev).


Building the eclim installer
============================

It should be rare that someone should need to build the eclim
installer, but should the need arise here are the instructions for
doing so.

To build the installer you first need a couple external tools
installed:

- sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org): Sphinx is used to build the eclim
  documentation which is included in the installer.  Please note
  however that eclim includes extensions to sphinx which target a
  specific version, so you should install the version that those
  extensions were built for.  The most reliable way to determine the
  proper version is to view the git log for eclim's sphinx extensions,
  typically the most recent log entry will note the proper sphinx
  version:

  >
     $ git log -1 src/doc/extension/
     commit df2e9f250b2ccdf53ed7932018acec808ae4538f
     Author: ervandew <ervandew@gmail.com>
     Date:   Sun Nov 1 20:27:45 2009 -0800

         update to sphinx 0.6.3

  <

- formic (http://github.com/ervandew/formic): The eclim installer has
  been developed using the formic framework, and requires it to build
  the installer distributables.  Formic doesn't currently have an
  official release, so you'll need to check out the source code:

  >
     $ git clone git://github.com/ervandew/formic.git

  <

  After checking out the code, you'll need to build the formic
  distribution:

  >
     $ cd formic
     $ ant dist

  <

  Then extract the formic tar to the location of your choice

  >
     $ tar -zxvf build/dist/formic-0.2.0.tar.gz -C /location/of/your/choice

  <

Once you have installed the above dependencies, you can then build the
eclim installer with the following command.

>

   $ ant -Dformic.home=/your/formic/install/dir dist

<



What's Next
===========

Now that you're familiar with the basics of building and patching
eclim, the next step is to familiarize yourself with the eclim
architecture and to review the detailed docs on how new features are
added.

All of that and more can be found in the eclim development docs
(|development-index|).
