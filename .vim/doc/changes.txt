C/C++:
   - Fixed :CSearch results on Windows platforms.

     to the eclipse representation of a source file, eclim would force
     a full refresh of the current project to ensure that any external
     additions, deletions, or changes to other files would be
     automatically detected. However, this approach, while convenient
     and transparent to the user, comes with a performance penalty
     that grows as the project size grows.

     For some users this performance penalty has been more noticeable
     than for others.  So in response to this feedback, eclim no
     longer performs an automatic project refresh.  What this means
     for you is that any time you perform an action that results in
     any file additions, deletions, or changes, like a svn / cvs
     update, you should issue a |:ProjectRefresh| to ensure that
     eclipse and eclim are updated with the latest version of the
     files on disk.

   - |:ProjectCreate| now supports optional -p argument for specifying
     the project name to use.

   - Created new command |:ProjectRefreshAll| to support refreshing
     all projects at once, and modified |:ProjectRefresh| to only
     refresh the current project if no project names are supplied.

   - Added |:ProjectGrep|, |:ProjectGrepAdd|, |:ProjectLGrep|, and
     |:ProjectLGrepAdd|.

   - Added support for buffer local variable b:EclimLocationListFilter
     which can contain a list of regular expression patterns used to
     filter location list entries with text / message field matching
     one of the patterns.  The main intention of this new variable is
     to allow you to filter out validation errors / warnings per file
     type, that you wish to ignore.

     Example which I have in my .vim/ftplugin/html/html.vim file:

     >
        let b:EclimLocationListFilter = [
            \ '<table> lacks "summary" attribute'
          \ ]
