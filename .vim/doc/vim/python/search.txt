Python Search

*:PythonFindDefinition*


Element Search
==============

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any
element in a source file (method call, class name, constant) and
perform a search for that element by issuing the command
:PhpFindDefinition.

If only one result is found and that result is in the current source
file, the cursor will be moved to the element found.  Otherwise, on
single result matches, the value of |g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult|
will be consulted for the action to take.  If there are multiple
results, the location list will be opened with the list of results.

Note: Searching support is provided via eclim's integration with rope
  (|vim-python-rope|).Please see the rope (|vim-python-rope|) docs for
  more information.

*:PythonSearchContext*

As a convenience eclim also provides the command :PythonSearchContext.
This command accepts no arguments and will perform the appropriate
search depending on the context of the element.

- If the cursor is on the declaration of a class, function, or method
  then it will search for all occurrences.

- Otherwise, it will search for the declaration of the element.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables

*g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult*

- g:EclimPythonSearchSingleResult (Default: 'split') - Determines what
  action to take when a only a single result is found.

  Possible values include:

  - 'split' - open the result in a new window via "split".

  - 'edit' - open the result in the current window.

  - 'tabnew' - open the result in a new tab.

  - 'lopen' - open the location list to display the result.

  This setting overrides the global default for all supported language
  types which can be set using the g:EclimDefaultFileOpenAction
  setting which accepts the same possible values.

- g:EclimLocationListHeight (Default: 10) - Sets the height in lines
  of the location list window when eclim opens it to display search
  results.
