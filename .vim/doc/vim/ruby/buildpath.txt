Ruby Build Path
***************

The ruby build path is used by eclipse to determine the location of
your project's source files, external libraries, etc.  Management of
your build path is provided by the eclim dltk plugin.

Please see the dltk buildpath (|vim-dltk-buildpath|) docs for
information on editing and maintaining your project's build path file.
