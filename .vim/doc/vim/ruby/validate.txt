Ruby Validation
***************

When saving a ruby source file that resides in a project, eclim will
update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation
errors found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the
source file will be marked via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>'
markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of ruby source files can be disabled via the
g:EclimRubyValidate variable (described below).  If you choose to
disable automatic validation, you can still use the :Validate command
to manually validate the current file.

Note: This feature depends on the eclipse dltk (http://eclipse.org/dltk)
  ruby plugin which should be installed for you when choosing ruby
  support in the eclim installer.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables:

*g:EclimRubyValidate*

- g:EclimRubyValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables source code
  validation.

- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
