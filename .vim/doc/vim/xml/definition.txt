Xml Definition Lookup
*********************

When editing xml files, eclim provides a couple commands which allow
you to quickly and easily open the file's data definition and
optionally jump to the definition of a particular element.

Note: When opening urls, these commands rely on netrw (:help netrw).

*:DtdDefinition*

- :DtdDefinition [<element>] - When invoked, this command will attempt
  to locate the dtd declaration in the current xml file and open the
  dtd in a new split window.  If you supply an element name when
  invoking the command, it will attempt to locate and jump to the
  definition of that element within the dtd.  If no element name is
  supplied, but the cursor is located on an element name when invoke,
  that element name will be used.

*:XsdDefinition*

- :XsdDefinition [<element>] - Behaves like :DtdDefinition except this
  command locates and opens the corresponding schema definition file.
