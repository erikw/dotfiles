*vim-xml-validate*


Xml Validation
**************

When editing a xml file eclim will default to validating the file when
it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

If you don't want xml files validated when saving them, you can set
the g:EclimXmlValidate variable described in the configuration section
below.

Regardless of whether you have validation enabled upon saving or not,
the following command is still available for validating xml files on
demand.

*:Validate_xml*

:Validate [<file>] - Validate the supplied file or the current file if
no file name provided.

If eclimd is not currently running, and the xmllint command is
available, eclim will validate the xml file using that.  Eclim will
never use xmllint when saving the file with g:EclimXmlValidate
enabled.
