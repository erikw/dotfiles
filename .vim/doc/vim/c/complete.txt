C/C++ Code Completion
*********************

C/C++ code completion uses the standard Vim code completion mechanism
(|vim-code-completion|) like so:

>

   #include <st<C-X><C-U>
   #include <stio.h>

   int main(void) {
     pu<C-X><C-U>
     puts(
     puts("Hello World");
     return EX<C-X><C-U>
     return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }

<


Note: This feature depends on the eclipse cdt (http://eclipse.org/cdt)
  which should be installed for you when choosing c/c++ support in the
  eclim installer.

Warning: C/C++ completion has been disabled on Windows when using the
  headless version of eclim because of a native call which blocks
  indefinitely.  Hopefully in the future this issue will be resolved
  or a work around found.
