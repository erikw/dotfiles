C/C++ Project Configuration
***************************

Note: This feature is currently considered alpha.  If you have any issues
  or suggestions please submit them to the eclim user
  (http://groups.google.com/group/eclim-user) mailing list.Also,
  please note that should you need access to the full set of cdt
  configuration options, you can always open the eclipse gui (after
  stopping any headless eclimd instance you may have running) and
  access those options via the standard cdt project dialogs.

The eclipse cdt provides a large set of configuration support for your
c/c++ projects.  Eclim exposes a subset of these to you using the
:CProjectConfigs command:

>

   :CProjectConfigs

   " or if you are outside of the project
   :CProjectConfigs my_c_project

<


This command will open a temporary buffer displaying some of the cdt
configuration values available to you.  In this buffer you can add or
remove source directory references, include path references, and
symbols.

Here is a small example of what the contents may look like:

>

   Config: Linux GCC

     Sources: |add|
       dir:    src

     Tool: GCC C Compiler
       Includes: |add|
         path:    "${workspace_loc:/my_c_project/includes}"
       Symbols:  |add|

     Tool: GCC Assembler
       Includes: |add|

<


To add a source directory, include path, or symbol, simply move the
cursor over the relevant "|add|" link and hit <enter>.  You will then
be prompted to enter an appropriate value.  For your convenience, tab
completion is provided where possible.

Note: Despite the odd looking value in the includes path section above, to
  add the entry you simply need to supply the project relative path,
  "includes/" in this case, when prompted by the add command.

If at any point you would like to remove a value, you can move the
cursor over the line of the value you would like to remove and hit D
(shift-d) to delete the entry.
