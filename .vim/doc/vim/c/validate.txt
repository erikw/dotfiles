*vim-c-validate* *:Validate_c*


C/C++ Validation
****************

When saving a c/c++ source file that resides in a project, eclim will
update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation
errors found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the
source file will be marked via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>'
markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of c/c++ source files can be disabled via the
g:EclimCValidate variable (described below).  If you choose to disable
automatic validation, you can still use the :Validate command to
manually validate the current file.

Note: This feature depends on the eclipse cdt (http://eclipse.org/cdt)
  which should be installed for you when choosing c/c++ support in the
  eclim installer.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables:

*g:EclimCValidate*

- g:EclimCValidate (Default: 1) - If set to 0, disables source code
  validation.

- g:EclimValidateSortResults (Default: 'occurrence') - If set to
  'severity', the validation results will be sorted by severity
  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
