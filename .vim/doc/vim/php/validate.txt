Php Validation
**************

When saving a php source file that resides in a project, eclim will
update that source file in Eclipse and will report any validation
errors found.  Any errors will be placed in the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and the corresponding lines in the
source file will be marked via Vim's :sign functionality with '>>'
markers in the left margin.

Automatic validation of php source files can be disabled via the
g:EclimPhpValidate variable (described below).  If you choose to
disable automatic validation, you can still use the :Validate command
to manually validate the current file.

Note: This feature depends on the eclipse pdt (http://eclipse.org/pdt)
  which should be installed for you when choosing php support in the
  eclim installer.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables:

*g:EclimPhpValidate*

  validation.

  (errors > warnings > info > etc.)
