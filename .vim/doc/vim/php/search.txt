Pattern Search
==============

Pattern searching provides a means to widen a search beyond a single
element.  A pattern search can be executed using the command

   :PhpSearch -p <pattern> [-t <type> -s <scope> -i]

All of the results will be placed into the current window's location
list (:help location-list) so that you can easily navigate the
results.

Vim command completion is supported through out the command with the
exception of the pattern to search for.

>

   :PhpSearch <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t class <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t class -s <Tab>
   :PhpSearch -p MyClass* -t class -s project

<


- -p <pattern>: The pattern to search for.

  Ex.

     MyClass

     myFunction

     my*

- -t <type> (Default: all): The type of element to search for where
  possible types include

  - class

  - function

  - field

- -s <scope> (Default: all): The scope of the search where possible
  values include

  - all - Search the whole workspace.

  - project - Search the current project, dependent projects, and
    libraries.

- -i: Ignore case when searching.


Element Search
==============

Element searching allows you to place the cursor over just about any
element in a source file (method call, class name, constant) and
perform a search for that element.  Performing an element search is
the same as performing a pattern search with the exception that you do
not specify the -p option since the element under the cursor will be
searched for instead.

If only one result is found and that result is in the current source
file, the cursor will be moved to the element found.  Otherwise, on
single result matches, the value of |g:EclimPhpSearchSingleResult|
will be consulted for the action to take.  If there are multiple
results, the location list will be opened with the list of results.

*:PhpSearchContext*

As a convenience eclim also provides the command :PhpSearchContext.
This command accepts no arguments and will perform the appropriate
search depending on the context of the element.

- If the cursor is on the file name in a require or include call, it
  will search the configured include path for the file.

- Otherwise, it will search for the declaration of the element.


Configuration
=============

Vim Variables

*g:EclimPhpSearchSingleResult*

- g:EclimPhpSearchSingleResult (Default: 'split') - Determines what
  action to take when a only a single result is found.

  Possible values include:

  - 'split' - open the result in a new window via "split".

  - 'edit' - open the result in the current window.

  - 'tabnew' - open the result in a new tab.

  - 'lopen' - open the location list to display the result.

  This setting overrides the global default for all supported language
  types which can be set using the g:EclimDefaultFileOpenAction
  setting which accepts the same possible values.

- g:EclimLocationListHeight (Default: 10) - Sets the height in lines
  of the location list window when eclim opens it to display search
  results.

Note: Search support depends on the eclipse pdt (http://eclipse.org/pdt)
  which should be installed for you when choosing php support in the
  eclim installer.
