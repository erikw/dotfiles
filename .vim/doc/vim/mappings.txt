Suggested Vim Mappings
**********************

Since each person has their own preference when it comes to key
mappings, eclim deliberately omits any convenience mappings for the
provided functionality.

So, instead this page provides some suggested mappings and examples
that may or may not suit your tastes, but will at least give you a
template that you can use to define your own mappings.

Note: In the mappings below you will see <leader> used quite frequently.
  In Vim the <leader> argument is mapped to a character of your
  choice.  Please see ":help mapleader" in Vim for more information.

*CMappings*


C/C++ Mappings
==============

Here are some mappings for the c/c++ funtionality provided by eclim.
To make use of these mappings, simply create a ftplugin file for c/cpp
and place your mappings there (:help ftplugin-name).

- The following mapping allows you to simply hit <enter> on an element
  to perform a search to find it.

  >
     nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <cr> :CSearchContext<cr>

  <

*AntMappings*


Ant Mappings
============

  >
     noremap <silent> <buffer> <cr> :AntDoc<cr>

     nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <leader>i :JavaImport<cr>

  <

- If you are doing django development you may want to use the
  following mapping which will execute :DjangoViewOpen, or
  :DjangoTemplateOpen depending on the context of the text under the
  cursor and if no results were found from either of those, it will
  issue :PythonFindDefinition.

  >
     function! s:MyFind ()
       let found = eclim#python#django#find#ContextFind()
       if !found
         PythonFindDefinition
       endif
     endfunction
     nnoremap <silent> <buffer> <cr> :call <SID>MyFind()<cr>
