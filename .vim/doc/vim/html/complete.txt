Html Code Completion
********************

Html code completion uses the standard Vim code completion mechanism
(|vim-code-completion|) like so:

>

   <ht<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <he<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <lin<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <link ty<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>

   <html>
     <head>
       <link type
   ...

<


Warning: Html completion has been disabled on Windows when using the headless
  version of eclim because of a native call which blocks indefinitely.
  Hopefully in the future this issue will be resolved or a work around
  found.
