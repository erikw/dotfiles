Code Completion
***************

All the code completion functionality provided by eclim (ant, java,
etc) makes use of the new "User Defined Completion" added to Vim 7.
To initiate code completion enter insert mode and type Ctrl-X Ctrl-U.
By default Vim will open a popup if there is more than one completion.

Example with java completion

Once you have started the completion you can use Ctrl-N to proceed to
the next match and Ctrl-P to move to the previous match.

If you are like me and you find those key strokes a bit cumbersome,
then you can use the SuperTab
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643) plugin which
allows you to use the Tab key for completion.
