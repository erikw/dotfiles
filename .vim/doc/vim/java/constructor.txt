Class Constructor Generation
****************************

*:JavaConstructor*

:JavaConstructor is a command that will create either an empty
constructor, or one that takes any selected fields as arguments.

For example if you have the following class:

>

   public class Foo
   {
     private int id;
     private String name;
   }

<


If you were to select the range containing the 'id' and 'name' fields
and issue :JavaConstructor, then you would end up with the following
code.

>

   public class Foo
   {
     private int id;
     private String name;

     /**
      * Constructs a new instance.
      *
      * @param id The id for this instance.
      * @param name The name for this instance.
      */
     public Foo (int id, String name)
     {
       this.id = id;
       this.name = name;
     }
   }

<


If you issue the command with no fields selected, then a default empty
constructor is created.

Note: The insertion of constructors is done externally with Eclipse and
  with that comes a couple caveats (|vim-issues|).
