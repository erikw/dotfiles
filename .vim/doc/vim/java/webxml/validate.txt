WEB-INF/web.xml Validation
**************************

When editing a web.xml file eclim will default to validating the file
when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

Eclim also combines the above validation with xml validation (|vim-
xml-validate|) to validate that the file is well formed.

If you do not want your web.xml files validated automatically when
saved, you can set the |g:EclimWebXmlValidate| variable described in
the configuration section below.

*:Validate_webxml*

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command :Validate to manually execute the validation of the file.
