TestNG
******

Currently eclim's support for TestNG (http://testng.org/doc) is
limited to supporting Vim's :make in conjunction with ant to populate
vim's quickfix results with failed test cases.

By default TestNG's output to the console is very terse.  So in order
to support monitoring of failed test cases via vim's error format,
eclim provides a custom TestNG listener which must be installed into
your build environment.

1. The first step is to place the eclim-testng.jar file in your TestNG
   classpath you have configured for ant.  You can find this jar file
   in your $ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclim.jdt_version/ directory.

2. The second step is to add the listener attribute to your testng
   task which references the required eclim testng listener:

   >
        ...
      <testng ... listener="org.eclim.testng.TestNgListener">
        ...

   <

   See the testng ant task docs (http://testng.org/doc/ant.html) for
   more information.

Once you have completed that setup, you should then be able to run
your ant target from vim and (as long as eclim is running) all failed
test cases will be added to your vim quickfix results.

Ex. Assuming your ant task is named 'test':

>

   :Ant test
