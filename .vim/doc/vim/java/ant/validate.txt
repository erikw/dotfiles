Ant File Validation
*******************

When editing an ant xml file eclim will default to validating the file
when it is written.  Any errors will be added to the current window's
location list (:help location-list) and their corresponding line
number noted via Vim's sign functionality.

Currently the Eclipse ant file validation isn't as robust as one might
hope.  It doesn't validate that element attributes are correct, that
child elements are valid, etc., but it does perform the following:

- If a default target is specified, validate that it exists and that
  the target dependencies exist.

- Check for missing dependencies.

- Check for circular dependencies.

Eclim also combines the above validation with xml validation (|vim-
xml-validate|) to validate that the ant file is well formed.

If you do not want your ant files validated automatically when saved,
you can set the |g:EclimAntValidate| variable described in the
configuration section below.

*:Validate_ant*

Whether or not auto validation has been enabled, eclim also exposes
the command :Validate to manually execute the validation of the ant
file.
