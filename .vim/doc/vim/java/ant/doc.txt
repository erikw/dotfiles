Ant Documentation Lookup
************************

*:AntDoc*

When editing an ant build file eclim defines a command named :AntDoc
which will attempt to lookup and open in your configured browser
(|g-eclimbrowser|) the documentation for the element under the cursor
or, if supplied, the element passed to it.

This command will only lookup element names, not attribute names or
values.

By default this plugin is configured to find all the standard ant
tasks, types, etc, as well as those defined by the antcontrib (http
://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net) project.

*:AntUserDoc*

If you have other tasks that you wish to add to this plugin, you can
do so by defining the global variable g:AntUserDocs.  The value of
this variable is expected to be a map of element names to the url
where the documentation for that element can be found.  The url also
supports a substitution variable, <element> which will be substituted
with the lower case version of the element name.

The following is an example which adds the tasks from the apache
cactus project.

>

   let s:cactus =
     \ 'http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/integration/ant/task_<element>.html'
   let g:AntUserDocs = {
       \  'cactifywar'     : s:cactus,
       \  'cactifyear'     : s:cactus,
       \  'cactus'         : s:cactus,
       \  'runservertests' : s:cactus,
       \  'webxmlmerge'    : s:cactus,
     \ }
