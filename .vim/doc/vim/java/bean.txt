Java Bean Functionality
***********************

Eclim currently provides the ability to generate java bean getters and
setters from one or more defined fields.

*:JavaGetSet*

- :JavaGetSet - Generates both getters and setters for the field under
  the cursor or for all fields in the specified range.

*:JavaGet*

- :JavaGet - Generates getters for the field under the cursor or for
  all fields in the specified range.

*:JavaSet*

- :JavaSet - Generates setters for the field under the cursor or for
  all fields in the specified range.

Given the following file:

>

   public class Foo
   {
     private String name;
     private Bar[] bars;
   }

<


You can place the cursor on one of the fields and execute :JavaGetSet
to generate the getters and setters for the field.  All of the above
commands support ranges as well, so you can use a visual selection or
a numbered range to generate methods for a set of fields.

Note: The insertion of these methods is done externally with Eclipse and
  with that comes a couple caveats (|vim-issues|).


Configuration

Vim Variables
