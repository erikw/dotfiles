Java Tools Integration
**********************

*:Jps*

As of Java 1.5 (Java 5.0), the sun jdk started shipping with some
useful tools for viewing information about running java processes.  To
provide quick and easy access to some of the information these
commands provide, eclim exposes the command :Jps.

Note: For more information on the jdk tools you may view the online
  documentation
  (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/tooldocs/index.html#manage).

When invoked it will open a window containing information about the
current processes and some links for viewing additional info
(depending upon availability of required tools on your platform).

Example content:

- Line 1 consists of the process id followed by either the class name
  the process was started with or the path to the jar file.

- Lines 2 - 4 contains links that when you hit <enter> on, will open
  another window displaying the requested additional info.

- Lines 6 - 31 is a folded block which contains a list of all the
  arguments passed to the main method of the process.

- Lines 33 - 35 is a folded block which contains a list of all the
  arguments passed to the JVM.
