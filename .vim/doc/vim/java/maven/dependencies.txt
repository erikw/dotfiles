Maven Dependencies
******************

*:MavenDependencySearch* *:MvnDependencySearch*

Maven provides online repositories where it will download dependencies
from at build time.  One problem is that finding all your dependencies
and then adding them to your pom file can become labor intensive.  To
help alleviate this, eclim provides commands for searching via the web
service provided by jarvana.com (http://www.jarvana.com/jarvana/).

- :MavenDependencySearch <artifact> - Available when editing a maven
  1.x project.xml file.

- :MvnDependencySearch <artifact> - Available when editing a maven 2.x
  pom.xml file.

These two commands will search for the specified artifact and open a
window containing the results.  You can then add one of the results as
a dependency to your pom file by simply hitting <enter> on it.

Example when calling :MvnDependencySearch junit
