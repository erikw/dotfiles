Java Code Correction
********************

*:JavaCorrect*

Code correction in eclim is equivalent to the quick fix functionality
of Eclipse. When you save a java source file, eclim validates (|vim-
java-validate|) the file and notes which lines contain errors.  To
have eclim suggest possible corrections for an error, you simply place
the cursor on the error line and issue :JavaCorrect.

The result will be a small window opened at the bottom of Vim where
any correction proposals will be noted. To apply a suggested change,
simply move the cursor to the line describing the modification and hit
<enter>. Upon doing so, the change will be applied to the source file.

Example output of :JavaCorrect.

>

   The serializable class Foo does not declare a static final serialVersionUID field of type long
   0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'
     ...
     @SuppressWarnings("serial")
     public class Foo
     implements Serializable
   ...

<


To apply the above change you would hit <enter> on the line:

>

   0.1227:  Add @SuppressWarnings 'serial' to 'Foo'

Note: The code correction is done externally with Eclipse and with that
  comes a couple caveats (|vim-issues|).
