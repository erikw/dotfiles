# msmtp configuration.
# msmtp has the advantage that it can be configured per user, so without messing with the system's default MTA used for system mails.
# For laptops: prefer postfix, as a laptop won't run a system MTA anyways, and a laptop does not always have internet connection  which postfix solves by having mail queues.
# For servers: msmtp is good as it can run in parallel to system's default MTA. It's okay to have the extra synchronous send, and the server always have network connection, unlike a laptop.
